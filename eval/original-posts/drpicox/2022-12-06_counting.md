# Counting

Sometimes it is difficult to know if we have enough cars to fed villagers,
or enough food. 

Because of it, we are adding a new counter that will show if there is enough food.

## The counters

They show the sum of all of "Eats" tags minus the sum of all "Food" tags:

 * Given there are 1 "Villager" cards.
 * Given there are 2 "Militia" cards.
 * Given there are 5 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 1 "Apple" cards.
 * Reload the game.
 * The counter "Remaining food" should be 2.
